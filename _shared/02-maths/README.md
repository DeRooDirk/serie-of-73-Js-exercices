# The Hill: JavaScript

Welcome to the JavaScript folder.

- Repository name: `73-javascript-exercises`
- Mode: `solo`
- Type of Challenge: `learning`
- Duration: `1-2 weeks`
- Deployment strategy: Not needed for these exercises

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this challenge you will:

- be able to code using **JavaScript**

## The Mission

The folder consists of 73 exercises, divided into 11 series.  
Don't be afraid of the number: most of these exercises are very short and focus on a particular aspect.  
The exercises follow one another in a _relatively_ logical way, but don't let one exercise stop you: go to the next, come back to it later.

> ☝️ Each exercise must be done.

> 🤟 **NOTE:** The exercises in series 9 are a little more complex, worth a try: they are good syntheses of the progress made.

### ES2015 What?

You will see very soon in your research that there is an "old" JavaScript and a "new" JavaScript, called ES6 or ES2015, but also ES2016, ES2017, ESNEXT etc.

What does it mean? Well, it would be a good idea to explain this mess in a watch - _wink, wink_ - but don't worry too much about it: for this exercices, you just have to remember that the current accepted standard is ES6+.
